            <h1>Meet the Artist:</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Lauren (aka LolaPaints). I am a 27 year old from a small town in Kansas. Through personal struggle and looking for an outlet in high school I found my way into the world of painting. Initially I started doodling and drawing and eventually began learning how to push paint around. Painting began as a hobby and now is a therapeutic way of life.</p>
            <p>I am so grateful for all of the experiences that have brought me to this level of creativity. My art style is very much abstract, some would say psychedelic, and extremely colorful.
                I paint based on emotions I am feeling and rarely begin with a plan in place. Many of my works were created on blank canvas and built upon as the projects progressed.</p>
            <p>I've created this website in order to share my artwork, offer the ability for purchase of original art works, and to inspire others to begin or continue creating.
                I enjoy painting most of all, but also dabble in digital artwork as well.</p>
                <p>My Goals as an Artist:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Improve painting skills overall</li>
                <li>Begin selling art and making custom trays and coasters</li>
                <li>Try to learn how to use oil paints for realism paintings</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p>Thanks for checking out my page,<br>
                Lauren, xo
